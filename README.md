# Daves Mic Volume Override
simple tool to override applications (Teams i'm looking at you) that keep trying to turn up the mic gain, and picking up background voices.

it just gets a call when the volume changes and resets it... note if you ran this twice it would probably use a lot of cpu moving the volume up and down..

As with all my code,  this code is very simple and just an example of what you can do. It's not production ready, as there is little error handling etc. 

So use it however you wish in accordance to the licence.
